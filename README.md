About me ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Goran. Since the beginning of 2023 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself. Since I am learning Polish Sign Language, the subject of accessibility is particularly important to me. In the QA position I see the potential to make, at the very least, the digital world more welcoming for every person. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.
