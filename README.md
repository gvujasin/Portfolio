## My experience üè¢
My QA journey started over 5 years when I transitioned from role of App publishing manager to QA. In that role, I've gained a lot of experience both in my tech and soft skills. I've learned to work with a set of different tools that are used in SDLC process. Some of my responsibilities included clear and consise issue reporting, creating various documenations, reports and onboarding manuals, day-to-day involvement in agile framework (planning sprints, grooming backlog, participating in daily meetings, review), various testing methods (exploratory, integration, regression) on both web and mobile applications, extensive knowledge on using a various set of tools ranging from JIRA, Google Workspace, Slack, Apple & Google tools for mobile app development. I also become more vocal, adaptible, my analytical thinking grew as well as my attention to details and teamwork.
